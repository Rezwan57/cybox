# Project Cybox: Usability Test Questions

## I. First Impressions & Onboarding (5-10 minutes)

*Goal: To understand the user's initial reactions and their experience getting started with the application.*

1.  Please take a few moments to look at the screen. What are your immediate impressions of the interface?
2.  What do you think the purpose of this application is?
3.  How would you describe the overall look and feel? Does it remind you of anything you've used before?
4.  Is the initial setup process (if any) clear and easy to follow?
5.  What do you expect to be able to do within this environment?

## II. UI/UX & Realism (15-20 minutes)

*Goal: To evaluate the intuitiveness, ease of use, and realism of the simulated desktop environment.*

1.  Please try to open and close a few applications from the dock. Was this process straightforward?
2.  How would you describe the experience of moving and resizing the application windows? Does it behave as you would expect?
3.  Navigate the header bar. Is it clear what each element does?
4.  How does the overall responsiveness of the UI feel to you?
5.  On a scale of 1-5 (1 being not at all, 5 being very realistic), how much does this feel like a real computer desktop? Please explain your rating.

## III. Core Application Functionality (20-25 minutes)

*Goal: To test the core features and functionality of the individual simulated applications.*

1.  **File Manager:**
    *   Open the File Manager. Can you easily navigate through the different folders?
    *   Try to find a specific file (e.g., a system log or a user document). Was it easy to locate?

2.  **Console/Terminal:**
    *   Open the Console. Please try running a few commands like `ls` or `ping`.
    *   Is the output of the commands clear and understandable?
    *   How intuitive is it to use the console for basic tasks?

3.  **Browser:**
    *   Launch the Browser. Navigate to a simulated website mentioned in a task.
    *   Is the browsing experience smooth? Does it behave like a real web browser?

4.  **Email App:**
    *   Open the Email App. Can you figure out how to read incoming emails and compose a new one?
    *   Is the layout familiar and easy to understand?

5.  **Bank App:**
    *   Explore the Bank App. What features do you see?
    *   Try to check your account balance or view transaction history. Was the process clear?

## IV. Gameplay & Scenario-Based Tasks (25-30 minutes)

*Goal: To assess how users interact with the cybersecurity scenarios and whether the gameplay is engaging and effective.*

**Scenario 1: Phishing Email Investigation**

*   **Task:** "You have received a suspicious email. Open the Email App, identify the email, and investigate it to determine if it is a threat. Use any tools you think are necessary."
*   **Questions:**
    1.  What was your first step after reading the task description?
    2.  Which applications did you use to investigate the email? Why did you choose them?
    3.  Were you able to identify the signs of a phishing attempt?
    4.  Was there any point where you felt stuck or unsure what to do next?
    5.  How engaging did you find this challenge?

**Scenario 2: Configuring the Firewall**

*   **Task:** "You need to strengthen the system's security by configuring the firewall. Open the Settings app and ensure the firewall is enabled. Then, use the Console to add a new rule to block all incoming traffic on port 8080."
*   **Questions:**
    1.  Were you able to find the firewall settings in the Settings app?
    2.  How did you go about adding a new firewall rule in the Console?
    3.  What was the command you used to add the firewall rule?
    4.  Do you think the process of configuring the firewall was intuitive?

## V. Learning & Educational Value (10-15 minutes)

*Goal: To gauge the educational effectiveness of the application.*

1.  Did you learn anything new about cybersecurity while using Project Cybox?
2.  Do you feel that interacting with these simulated scenarios helps in understanding real-world cybersecurity concepts?
3.  How would you rate the educational value of this application on a scale of 1-5 (1 being not educational, 5 being very educational)?
4.  What other cybersecurity topics would you be interested in learning about through this platform?

## VI. Overall Experience & Feedback (10 minutes)

*Goal: To gather final thoughts, suggestions, and identify any remaining issues.*

1.  What did you like most about Project Cybox?
2.  What did you like least, or what was the most frustrating part of your experience?
3.  If you could change one thing about the application, what would it be?
4.  Did you encounter any bugs, errors, or unexpected behavior?
5.  Would you recommend this application to someone interested in learning cybersecurity? Why or why not?
